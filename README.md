# How to Use the database?
You need to download the protocol for our database. We trust that the terms of this protocol are acceptable to you, and that you will be able to sign and email the attached copy of this protocol to us to confirm your agreement to its terms. The email address is hxwang@zjut.edu.cn.

Then, there are two ways to get data:
The first way is that we provide you with the Baidu cloud data links and you should download the data by yourself.
The second way is that  you send us the mobile hard disk which we will copy the data to, but the necessary expenses (postage, the cost of mobile hard disk and labor, i.e.) need to be paid by you.
You need to explain the way you choose in your email.

Thank you very much for your cooperation!
